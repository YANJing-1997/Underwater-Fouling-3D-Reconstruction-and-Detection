# Underwater-Fouling-3D-Reconstruction-and-Detection
Image-based 3D reconstruction method; Laboratory and field fouling tests data
The file 'MatlabCode' contain the fouling PCD segmentation approach and fouling feature algorithm.
The file 'UnderwaterImage-S2' is small number of the S2 underwater image.
The file 'FieldTestPCD-S1~S4' is the fouling 3D PCD of the field test.
The file 'LaboratoryTest-S1-reg-9.3.ply', 'LaboratoryTest-S4-reg-10.12.ply' and so on, is the underwater fouling 3D PCD of the laboratory test.
